[00:17.02] In a dream I can see you crystal clear
[00:24.89] When I'm awake I begin to disappear
[00:33.72] In a dream I can see you crystal
[00:41.03] When I'm awake I begin to disappear
[00:58.53] 
[02:12.77] She's burning here below my mind
[02:17.75] The green and purple smoke it rises, rises
[02:21.32] As every hidden wish collides
[02:24.93] Those illusions but I can't deny it
[02:29.48] She's burning in below my mind
[02:33.29] The green and purple smoke it rises, rises
[02:37.30] As every hidden wish collides
[02:41.43] I'm falling and I can't deny it
[02:45.56] I'm falling and I can't deny it
[02:49.56] I'm falling and I can't deny it
[02:53.89] I'm falling and I can't deny it
[02:57.62] I'm falling in
[03:04.62] 
[03:56.68] I'm falling and I can't deny it
[04:00.89] I'm falling and I can't deny it
