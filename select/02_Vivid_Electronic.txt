My imagination wants to see
The vivid colours of reality
There's a place out there beyond my grasp
A revolution in a looking glass
I've got to get this problem off my chest
I'm sick and tired of being second best
I'll rearrange my credibility
A fund raiser for a restless sea

Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you
Won't you forgive me
What are you gonna do?
Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you
Won't you forgive me
What are you gonna do
What will you do

I can't contain what's inside my head
I'm losing words that I must have read
Do you remember the time we spent
It seems that we were the main event
Have you a reason to behave like this
Maybe you need a psychoanalyst?
If you keep pushing me out of the door
For sure,
You'll never see me again

No one to talk to
What am I gonna do
You're never there
Right when I need you
Give me a cause
Give me a reason
For your applause
I'll commit treason

And in my mind I know I'm right
It's the same thing every night
You're not to blame so don't you cry
You don't need me so hurt my pride
In all that time I know we tried
Line by line and side by side
And still I pray that we'll get by
But it don't seem real and I don't know why

And in my mind I know I'm right
It's the same thing every night
You're not to blame so don't you cry
You don't need me so hurt my pride
And in my mind I know I'm right
It's the same thing every night
Why do you cry you're not to blame
When will you change this sad refrain
This sad refrain
Oh when will you change this sad refrain.
